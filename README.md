# About my discord bot
A bot on discord coded in python using discord's API capable of playing various games like coinflip, and a one-versus-one feature to try to win money from other players. The information can then be stored in a csv file as to not lose progress. The csv file is turned into a dictionary on bot-startup as to use the relavant information.
